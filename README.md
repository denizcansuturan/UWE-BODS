# UWE-BODS / Geospatial Analysis and Assessment of Bus Service Disruptions

## Overview

This repository contains the data, code, and documentation for the dissertation project titled **"Geospatial Analysis and Impact Assessment of Bus Service Disruptions: A Comprehensive Study Utilizing Bus Open Data with an Interactive Web Application"**. The project was conducted as part of the requirements for the School of Computing and Creative Technologies at the University of the West of England, Bristol.

## Project Description

The primary aim of this research is to enhance the understanding and management of bus service disruptions through geospatial analysis and the development of an interactive dashboard utilizing Bus Open Data Service (BODS) data. The study leverages real-time and historical data to analyze the spatial and temporal patterns of bus service disruptions and assess their impacts on urban mobility.

## Key Features

- **Geospatial Analysis**: Identifies disruption hotspots using point mapping and heatmaps.
- **Temporal Analysis**: Reveals disruption patterns over time through time-series visualizations.
- **Severity Analysis**: Categorizes disruptions by severity and maps their impact on the transport network.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Developed using Streamlit, the dashboard allows users to explore and visualize disruption data dynamically.

## Repository Contents

- **`data/`**: Contains the raw and processed datasets used for the analysis.
- **`scripts/`**: Python scripts for data cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis.
- **`dashboard/`**: Source code for the Streamlit dashboard.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and geospatial analysis.
- **`docs/`**: Documentation and reports, including the dissertation report.
- **`README.md`**: This file.

## Data Sources

- **Bus Open Data Service (BODS)**: A UK Department for Transport initiative providing real-time bus location and schedule data.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

## Usage

The interactive dashboard provides users with the ability to:

- **Visualize Disruption Hotspots**: Explore the geographical distribution of bus service disruptions.
- **Analyze Temporal Patterns**: Identify when disruptions are most frequent.
- **Assess Severity and Impact**: Understand the severity of disruptions and their consequences.

## Methodology

The project follows an agile development methodology, with iterative improvements based on continuous feedback. The key steps involved in the research include:

1. **Data Collection**: Gathering bus service disruption data from the BODS platform.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and standardizing the raw data.
3. **Geospatial Analysis**: Mapping disruption locations and identifying hotspots.
4. **Temporal Analysis**: Analyzing the timing and frequency of disruptions.
5. **Dashboard Development**: Building the interactive dashboard using Streamlit.

## Ethical Considerations

The project ensures compliance with data protection laws by only using publicly available, non-personally identifiable information (PII). The research is conducted transparently, with full disclosure of methodologies and data sources.

## Evaluation and Future Work

The dashboard has been pilot tested with a small group of users, and future iterations will incorporate real-time data and user feedback. The potential for expanding the research to include multiple cities and more complex spatial analysis is also discussed.
